        <p>
            Association Rule Mining(ARM) is used to identify occurence pattern in a large dataset.
            Association rule furthermore looks for interesting associations among the variables of the dataset.
            It is undoubtedly one of the most important concepts of Machine Learning
            and has been used in different cases.
            <br />
            <br />

            The goal here is to how find what words goes together in a tweet using ARM.
            ARM has two components,
            <ul>
                <li><strong>an antecedent (if) and</strong></li>
                <li><strong>a consequent (then)</strong></li>

            </ul>

            Examples would be, <strong>if</strong> word <strong>woman</strong> is used in a tweet
            <strong>then</strong> word <strong>pain</strong>
            being is used.
            <br />
            <strong>if</strong> word <strong>men</strong> is used in a tweet
            <strong>then</strong> word <strong>bold</strong> is being used.
            <br />
            <br />
            ARM is essentially used in Market Basket Analysis.
            <br />
            Market Based Analysis is one of the key techniques used by large relations to show associations between items.It allows
            retailers to identify relationships between the items that people buy together frequently.
            <br />

            <br />

            ARM uses three measures to find out associations.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Support: </strong>Popularity of item(s)</li>
                <br />

                <img src="assets/img/arm/support.jpg" alt="my image" class="image" width="45%" height="45%" />
                <li><strong>Confidence: </strong>How often the rule is valid</li>
                <br />
                <img src="assets/img/arm/confidence.jpg" alt="my image" class="image" width="45%" height="45%" />
                <li><strong>Lift: </strong>Tells the relationship between item(s)</li>
                <img src="assets/img/arm/lift.jpg" alt="my image" class="image" width="45%" height="45%" />

            </ul>
            <br />

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Lift = ~1:</strong> means support(Y) is independent i.e. It occurs same
                    amount of the time irrespective of its associationwith anyother item. So can't find any
                    association betweent those items'
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Lift > 1: </strong> means items in the set has strong possitive relationship.
                    i.e X and Y occurs to together than Y alone.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Lift < 1:</strong> means items in the set has negative relationship i.e. occurs of
                    Y can diminish the occurence of X.
                </li>
            </ul>

            This algorithm uses two steps “join” and “prune” to reduce the search space
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Join Step: This step generates (K+1) itemset from K-itemsets by
                    joining each item with itself.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Prune Step: This step scans the count of each item in the database.
                    If the candidate item does not meet minimum support, then it is
                    regarded as infrequent and thus it is removed. This step is
                    performed to reduce the size of the candidate itemsets.
                </li>
            </ul>

            In real practice, while using R/Python, we will be setting a threshold value for
            support and confidence in accordance with the data and goal.

            <h2>Result:ARM</h2>
        <p>
            Output from ARM is quite interesting,
            Evaluating the algorithm by setting RHS = men and RHS = women, below are the interesting
            association derived when,
            <br />
            <strong> RHS = men</strong>
            The image below is the output from the analysis by setting <strong>men</strong> as consequent(RHS).

            <strong>RHS = Woman</strong>

            <strong>Isn't it intreseting?'</strong>
            <br />
            The algorithm literally forgot that the dataset is based on men and woman in technology
            because there were very less tweets related to tech and woman.
