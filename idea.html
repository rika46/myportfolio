            <h2>Introduction:</h2>
            <p>
                Why woman in tech is an important topic to be discussed?

                <br />
                <br />
                Over the years, women have been encouraged to pursue technology. But today, there’s still a wide gap between men and women in tech.
                Even though, women make up about 47% of the U.S workforce, only 26.7% have jobs in the tech industry.
                According to Fortune, women run 8.8% of businesses on the Fortune 500 list in 2022.
                The percentage of female STEM graduates is about 19%. Women leave the tech industry at a 45% higher rate than men.
                After graduation, fewer women than men end up working in tech positions. But there’s no reason women shouldn’t be in technology. The tech industry needs gender diversity to continue thriving.
                It is quite likely that the outcome will be prejudiced, especially when it comes to the field of data science,
                due to the lack of diversity, where men are the team members who contribute the most to any project.
                <br />
                <br />
                How the gender bias in Data Science field affects the outcome?
                <br />
                <br />
                Before starting to answer this question, I would recommend anyone reading this article to watch the Netflix film called <strong>"Coded Bias"</strong>.
                <br />

                <br />
                It is very likely that the model or algorithm will be biased if the individuals developing the machine learning algorithm are themselves not diverse.
                <br />
                How is this related to my project?
                <br />
                <br />
                Well, I've always questioned whether the biases that people talk about are actually true. I wanted to see for myself how accurate these analyses are.
                I thought that I could do sentimental analysis on women in tech.

        <p>
            One idea that came to mind when I was considering how to get information about this specific issue was twitter data.
        </p>

        <br />

        <div>
            <p>
                In the twitter data, we can get many objects related to a user, tweets on various subjects, hashtags and more.
                I believe this information will help conduct my analysis.
            </p>
            These algorithms might not correctly represent the population.
            <p>

                <br />
                <strong>Twitter API format:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li> consumer_key = ' '</li>
                    <li>consumer_secret = ' '</li>

                    <li>access_token = ' '</li>
                    <li>access_token_secret = ' '</li>

                </ul>


            </p>
            <br />



        </div>
        <p>
            To get started with Twitter API, we first required to create a twitter developer account and follow several authentication processes,
            all of which will be thoroughly detailed in this <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/platform-overview">article</a>.

        </p>
