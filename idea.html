        <h2 style="text-align:center;">Where are the women in technology?</h2>
        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        Women are capable of doing not only household chores but also technology.
        Why woman in tech is an important topic to be discussed? Over the years, women have been encouraged to pursue technology.
        But today, there’s still a wide gap between men and women in tech. Even though, women make up about 47% of the U.S workforce,
        only 26.7% have jobs in the tech industry. According to Fortune, women run 8.8% of businesses on the Fortune 500 list in 2022.
        The percentage of female STEM graduates is about 19%. Women leave the tech industry at a 45% higher rate than men. After graduation,
        fewer women than men end up working in tech positions. But there’s no reason women shouldn’t be in technology. The tech industry needs gender
        diversity to continue thriving. It is quite likely that the outcome will be prejudiced, especially when it comes to the field of data science,
        due to the lack of diversity, where men are the team members who contribute the most to any project.

        <br />


        According to a research, women leave the tech field more frequently than men. People who believe that women are inferior to men when
        it comes to technology, make a blind judgment on this. However, the belief that women are quitting IT because they are not getting the
        necessary mentorship. They do not receive the same rights as males enjoy. For instance, women get paid less for the same skills.
        Lack of female role models could also be the reason for minority if women in IT. Women are often underrepresented in leadership positions
        in tech companies. This can make it difficult for women to advance their careers and achieve their goals.

        <br />
        How the gender bias in Data Science field affects the outcome? Before starting to answer this question, the Netflix film called "Coded Bias" says a
        lot about these biases. The narrator of this film says, “My own lived experiences show me that you cannot separate the social from the technical.
        (...) . Companies like Microsoft, IBM, Face++, Google and so on has their own facial recognition systems. It turned out these algorithms performed
        better with a light male face as the benchmark. It did better on the male faces than the female faces, and lighter face better than darker faces.”

        It is very likely that the model or algorithm will be biased if the individuals developing the machine learning algorithm are themselves
        not diverse. Tweets on twitter will be a primary data source for this analysis.
   Well, whether the biases that people talk about are actually true? how accurate these analyses are?.
        <br />
        <br />
        Questions that will be answered in this analysis are:
        <br />
        •	How many tweets have been tweeted about women in tech vs men in tech? (Visualization)
        <br />
        •	Are there negative tweets related to women in tech? (Analysis)
        <br />
        •	What is the popularity of women in tech tweets? (Visualization) This will be based on number of retweets on women in tech vs men in tech.
        <br />
        •	What type of user tweets about women in technology?
