            <h2>CONCLUSION: </h2>

            After analysis, it looks like tweets about men in technology is larger in number than woman in tech.
            It is also interpretable that, when a tweet contains content about woman in tech,
            it is somehow related to men due to which men in tech tweets counts are even larger.
            This topic is always sensational since 1986, where it started with women getting paid lesser than men for the same work.
            In a Netflix series called "History 101", season 1, episode: Feminism, the narrator says that it might take another 40
            years for a diverse society where women will have equal opportunities and equal pay as men. This blog explores the
            inequality of men and women in the field of technology.

            From this analysis, it seems that percentage women in IT industry must be increased. By far the most female-dominated
            occupations are personal care workers, such as health care assistants and home-based personal workers.
            People think women are capable in only these industries but tech.

            Women in technology can be increased by providing work experience to schoolgirls.
            Providing opportunities to participate in lectures will strengthen awareness and encourage women to pursue a
            career in tech. Promoting women from within or putting together new creative teams would also motivate them to reach
            new heights. It is also crucial to attract women in tech who are returning to work. They may possess developed skills
            and experience which could strengthen the tech company.

            The representation on women in technology industry remains low. Nevertheless,
            it appears that many initiatives are underway to promote women in technology.
            Due to the recent emergence of this awareness, it might take some years to achieve gender equality in technology.
            In the future, we hope to see more women in technology, achieving more and motivating the upcoming generations.

            Furthermore, most of the tweets about women comes from popular users.
            This says that people are trying to promote women in technology. Though there are more negativities regarding the women
            in tech. This might take years to change. Most of the reports says that the number of women in technology is low because
            women tend to discontinue from jobs. There could be other reasons for this like them being not promoted to next level in
            their field.

            <br />
            In addition, research indicates that women are paid less for the same job as men. Inequality in technology not only puts
            women behind but also produces biased results. For an unbiased algorithm/product more women need to be working in
            the same project as men. It is not that women are uninterested in technology. It is that women’s works are less
            recognized.

            Though there are more women now in the workforce, the tech industry is still very much a man’s world.
            Latest studies indicates that companies are practicing biased hiring which a good first step.
            This will increase women techies in companies. Women are becoming more stronger in technology.
            They are continually fighting to be heard. But it is going to take a long way for the equality and diversity in
            technology we all are looking forward for.
